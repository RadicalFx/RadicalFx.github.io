### **Easy peasy lemon squeezy, with the 5' tutorials!**

#### [WPF / Full framework](https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical/wiki/Quick-Start-%28WPF%29) &#124; [Universal Apps (WinRT & WP)](https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical/wiki/Quick-Start-%28Universal-App%29)

Setting up a new Radical application is as easy as:

* create a new `WPF` or `Universal App` project;
* remove a lot of code, yes remove :-)
* add Radical or Radical.Universal packages depending on your needs;
* define your first `View` and, if required, `ViewModel`;
* add one single line of code to bootstrap the application;

### **Visual Studio templates**

To make things as easy as possible we also have Visual Studio templates published on the Visual Studio gallery, [go and download](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5ff17cc4-ecf3-4395-9e18-d4673186e2fe) them to startup your project as fast as a lightning with all what you need.

* You can download the VSIX package directly from the Gallery to install if offline: [https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5ff17cc4-ecf3-4395-9e18-d4673186e2fe](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5ff17cc4-ecf3-4395-9e18-d4673186e2fe);
* Or you can use the Visual Studio "Extensions and Updates" dialog to install Radical templates, simply look for `Radical Templates`, or just `Radical`;
