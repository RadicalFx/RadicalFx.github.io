### **Get in touch**

We are here to help you to get the most out of Radical, the [WiKi](https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical/wiki) is the first place to look for information and documentation, if you can't find something in the WiKi that suites your needs please raise an [issue](https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical/issues) and we'll fix it.

If you find something wrong shame on us :-) but, please, do raise an issue, or if you already fixed it help us with a [pull request](https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical/wiki/Contribution-guideline) we will be very happy to support you for the entire process. 

We recently setup a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/radical-mvvm-framework) for technical discussions related to the Radical daily usage, the entire team is listening.
