### Concentrate on business needs not on infrastructure

Front-end developers needs to concentrate all their effort in building UIs that respond to their stakeholders needs not on the infrastructure required to support that UIs. Our goal is to support the developer with a powerful framework that provides all the infrastructure required to build amazing and easy to maintain user interface.

Radical comes with a predefined configuration, based on highly customizable conventions, that drives the developer in setting up the development environment in what we think is the most productive setup.

### Easy peasy lemon squeezy, with the 5' tutorials

#### [WPF](https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical/wiki/Quick-Start-%28WPF%29) | [Universal Apps](https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical/wiki/Quick-Start-%28Universal-App%29)

Setting up a new Radical application is as easy as:

* create a new `WPF` or `Universal App` project;
* remove a lot of code, yes remove :-)
* add Radical or Radical.Universal packages depending on your needs;
* define your first `View` and, if required, `ViewModel`;
* add one single line of code to bootstrap the application;

### Visual Studio templates

To make things as easy as possible we also have Visual Studio templates published on the Visual Studio gallery, [go and download](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/22dd31eb-3cb7-4027-972c-a6c96671cddd) them to startup your project as fast as a lightning with all what you need.

* You can download the VSIX package directly from the Gallery to install it offline: [https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/22dd31eb-3cb7-4027-972c-a6c96671cddd](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/22dd31eb-3cb7-4027-972c-a6c96671cddd);
* Or you can use the Visual Studio "Extensions and Updates" dialog to install Radical templates, simply look for `Radical Templates`, or just `Radical`;
